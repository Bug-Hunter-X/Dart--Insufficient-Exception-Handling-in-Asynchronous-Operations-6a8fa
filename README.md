# Dart Asynchronous Operation Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient exception handling within asynchronous operations. The `fetchData` function fetches data from an API.  While it includes a `try-catch` block, it doesn't differentiate between various exception types, hindering effective error management and debugging.

## Bug Description
The `fetchData` function lacks specific handling for different types of exceptions.  This means that all errors, regardless of their nature (e.g., network issues, JSON decoding errors, server errors), are caught in a generic `catch` block. This makes pinpointing the root cause of failures difficult.

## Solution
The solution involves enhancing the `try-catch` block to handle different exceptions appropriately. For example, differentiating between HTTP errors (indicated by response status codes) and other potential errors.
